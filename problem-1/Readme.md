# Problem A: Watermelon

## Problem Statement

One hot summer day, Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and ripest one, in their opinion. After that, the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed `w` kilograms.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers. Therefore, they want to divide the watermelon into two parts such that each part weighs an even number of kilograms. Note that it is not obligatory for the parts to be equal.

## Input
- The first (and the only) input line contains an integer `w` (1 ≤ w ≤ 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.

## Output
- Print **YES** if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each weighing an even number of kilograms. 
- Print **NO** otherwise.

## Example
**Input:**
```text
8
```

**Output:**
```text
YES
```

**Explanation:**
The boys can divide the watermelon into two parts weighing 4 kilos each (4 + 4 = 8), which are both even numbers.
